Yea.. this is gonna take some time. 

## Common Methods, Structs, & Fields

## Things I'd like to add to the UI
- Most components rendered by plotters. 
- EQ knob color kinda changes on freq intensity.
  - Such that if you focus some intense peak frequency, it'll have some post fader info and thus glow a bit harder
  - Still want it to be mostly ear based. Just have a slight modern feel to it.
